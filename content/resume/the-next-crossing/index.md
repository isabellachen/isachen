[The Next Crossing](http://thenextcrossing.com/) is my travel website with over 25k views per month. As travel is a very crowded space on the internet, the challenge with this project is the SEO optimisation of both the theme and the content. After a great deal of optimisation, some of my articles rank organically on page one of Google Search for competitive search terms. Some of my responsibilities include:

- Design of the website using Sketch
- Custom theme development with WordPress
- Custom plugin development
- Technical SEO optimisation
- SEO optimised content writing
