At Plain Concepts, I worked on various web projects, mostly commissioned by Microsoft.
Some of my work included:

- React frontend for Gen Studio, an interface letting users play with deep learning techniques and images from the MET's collection
- NodeJS based testing engine, Webhint IO, an opensource initiative by the OpenJS foundation
- VueJS frontend for Vector Search, an interface used to demo Bing's ANN algorithms for image search
