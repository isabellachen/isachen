Codeworks is one of Europe's most highly-rated software development boot camps. Over 50% of students who attend Codeworks have a STEM background in computing, physics or finance. They attend Codeworks to learn the very marketable skill of software development. My responsibilities were:

- Lectures on the fundamentals of JavaScript
- Lectures on how to solve algorithmic problems (the phone screen interview type, not the ones on Scott Aaronson's blog)
- One on one help with the student's projects, mostly in React, NodeJS and NoSQL databases
- CSS help requests. Lots of them.
