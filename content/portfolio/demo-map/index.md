Demo Map is a website showcasing various projects powered by the latest Microsoft technologies. The website has a colorful concept with animations, to make exploring these sites fun for the user.

## My Responsibilities

For this project, I implemented the navigation and responsive layout of the app. I ensured that the map and the buttons kept the same ratio and positions depending on the screen size. For smaller screens, an alternative layout for the map and buttons was implemented.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- VueJS with NuxtJS
- Strapi (a CMS built on NodeJS)
