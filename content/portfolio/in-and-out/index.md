In & Out is a marketing website showcasing attractions in Barcelona. The website is targeted at the Chinese market in mainland China. The website features content by Chinese and Catalan celebrities and entrepreneurs who work in Barcelona. They give interviews and recommendations on the website.

If you [visit the site](https://www.inandout-barcelona.cn/), please note that the website loads slowly because it's on servers behind China's great firewall.

## My Responsibilities

For this project, I developed several pages on the VueJS frontend, including the interactive map component. I also implemented controllers interfacing with content from the NodeJS CMS.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- VueJS with NuxtJS
- Strapi (a CMS built on NodeJS)
