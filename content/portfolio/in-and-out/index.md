In & Out is a marketing website showcasing attractions in Barcelona. The website is targeted at the Chinese market in mainland China. The website features content by Chinese and Catalan celebrities and entrepreneurs who work in Barcelona. They give interviews and recommendations on the website.

## My Responsibilities

For this project, I mainly worked on the tips page and the accompanying interactive map component. Depending on the tip the user has chosen, the map reflected that choice. I also worked in the NodeJS backend implementing controllers that interfaced with the Strapi content management system and fixing bugs.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- VueJS with NuxtJS
- Strapi (a CMS built on NodeJS)
