Lettra is a WordPress theme for writers. As a fiction writer myself, I found it difficult
to find a theme that was specifically designed for fiction. Many WordPress themes place too
much emphasis on images, a focus that most writers might not want. Lettra focuses on the
text, but includes small featured images to add a bit of color. I also wanted to have a menu
that was designed to accomodate large number links, in case users wanted to link to all the
chapters of a novel. Hence the scrollable navigation. This navigation also has two menu sections,
one for the writing and one for meta info (like about, contact, etc.)

Lettra comes with two configurable menus and three footer areas.
