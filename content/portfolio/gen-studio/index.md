Gen Studio is a collaboration between the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met), Microsoft and MIT. This online experience is an opportunity to explore generated, dreamlike images created by AI. The application is an interface between users and deep learning techniques. By manipulating an interactive graph, users can create new images from existing photos of artifacts from the MET.

For this project, Microsoft approached my team to redesign an existing website that had been created by engineers from MIT. The existing website had all the AI components, however it needed a full redesign to make it look slicker and sexier.

## My Responsibilities

I was tasked with implementing the new design and restructuring the React codebase. I reorganised the styles and wrote markup and styling to layout the site. I set up the routing for the pages. I restructured the components and their functionality for the new design. I fixed bugs and added code for component cleanup.

## Tech Stack

- React
- SCSS
