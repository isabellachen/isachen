Microsoft's Vector Serach engine uses deep learing models to represent data as vectors.
The Vector Search website is an interface that demonstrates the power of these models.
Users can upload an image, or choose one from a pre-generated grid of images and
send it to the Vector Search API. The API will respond with images that fulfill the
'closest neightbour' criteria of the image submitted.

## My Responsibilities

For this project, I coded the responsive layout and UI of the VectorSearch website. This includes
the markup and styling, the routing and the interactive elements (tabs, buttons and scrolling).
The responsive layout was particularly challenging as it had to be fully responsive and accomodate
images generated by the AI which came in different dimensions.
